# FragmentsNetworking

1. Completed steps:
    part01,
    part02,
    partially part03,
    part04
    
    
2. Easy concepts:
   RecyclerView, Fragment addition and replacement
   
3. Hard concepts:
   I understand how to pass data to Fragments by using Bundle.
   I don't understand how to get access to FragmentManager in ViewHolder, where we needed to pass data from. In ViewHolders we
   don't have reference to activity or other fragments to get a hold of FragmentManager. So I was not able to pass the data
   from ViewHolder to TopFragment.
